# Agentic AI Project

This project was developed as part of the **Agentic AI with LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, and BeeAI** course offered by IBM. It demonstrates the use of cloud-based IDE tools to build and experiment with autonomous AI agents using modern frameworks.

## Project Description

The project focuses on creating intelligent, autonomous agents capable of reasoning, acting, and collaborating using cutting-edge AI frameworks such as LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, and BeeAI. These agents are designed to handle complex workflows with controlled execution and memory management.

## Features

- Integration of multiple AI frameworks to build sophisticated agents
- Use of declarative requirements for predictable agent behavior
- Memory management and tool usage control within agents
- Support for multi-agent collaboration and human-in-the-loop approval
- Middleware for tracking and transparency of agent actions

## Getting Started

This project is intended to be run and developed within a cloud-based IDE environment provided by the course. Follow the course instructions to build, test, and extend your AI agents.

## Acknowledgments

This project is part of the IBM course **Agentic AI with LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, and BeeAI** and leverages the BeeAI Framework developed under the Linux Foundation AI & Data program and IBM Research.
